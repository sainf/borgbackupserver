# Borg Backup Server

![Dashboard](https://www.borgbackupserver.com/borg-backup-server.png)

A self-hosted web application for centrally managing [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/) across multiple endpoints (Linux, Mac and Windows). A lightweight agent polls the server for tasks over HTTPS, backs up over SSH to the server, and reports progress back. No inbound connections to endpoints from the server — this works behind firewalls and NAT from where the server is providing easy provisioning. Includes a setup wizard for simple installation or a Docker image to start up in 30 seconds.

## Features

- **Agent-based architecture** — endpoints check-in with the server for tasks, the server doesn't need ssh access to the agent
- **SSH with append-only security** — agents can only backup or restore, can't delete or prune
- **FULL Encryption** - Software keeps everything encrypted at rest for enhanced security
- **Setup wizard** — browser-based installer configures database, admin account, and storage quicky
- **Real-time progress** — live progress bars during backups with detailed logging
- **File-level restore** — catalog data is saved in ClickHouse DB for fast search and file-tree without having to lock the borg repo
- **Download archives** — extract and download files as .tar.gz directly from the browser
- **Database plugins** — MySQL and PostgreSQL pre-dumps with automatic restore back into the database as a copy or replacement
- **Flexible scheduling** — hourly to monthly intervals, multiple plans per client, manual trigger
- **Backup templates** — pre-configured and customizeable directory sets for common server roles
- **Retention policies** — per-plan prune settings (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **S3 offsite sync** — mirror repositories to S3-compatible storage (AWS, Wasabi, Backblaze B2) for enahnced compliance
- **Remote Storage Repos** — wizards to backup to BorgBase, Hetzen and rsync.net (or any SSH provider that provides borg)
- **Repo Management** - Perform hard unlocks, repair, re-catalog, and other repo specific features
- **Nightly Backup Reports** - get an email every day with backup stats
- **Multi-user** — custom role-based access with various roles
- **Two-factor authentication** — TOTP-based 2FA with recovery codes, hooks into your 2FA of choice
- **Queue management** — concurrent job limits, cancel/retry, progress tracking
- **Encrypted passphrases** — repository passwords encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- **Apprise alerts** — custom push notifications to over 100 different notification services (Slack, Pushover, etc)
- **Extensive Dashboard** — backup charts, server stats, active jobs, see everything at a glance
- **Server self-backup** — daily automated backup of BBS itself with optional S3 sync offsite with restore scripts
- **Automatic Self-Upgrade** - one-click upgrade of the software plus all the agents. Also manage borg versions of client machines

## Quick Start

Start with a fresh **Ubuntu 22.04+** server, then run:

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/main/bin/bbs-install
sudo bash bbs-install --hostname backups.example.com
```

The installer handles everything — packages, Apache, MySQL, SSL, and cron. When it finishes, open the URL and the setup wizard walks you through the rest.

See the **[full documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/wiki)** for installation details, agent setup, configuration, and usage guides.

## Architecture

- **HTTPS** for control plane (task polling, progress, status)
- **SSH** for data plane (borg backup/restore via `borg serve`)
- **Append-only** — agents cannot delete existing archives; pruning runs server-side
